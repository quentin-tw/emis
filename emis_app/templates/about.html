<h5>About This Demo Website <a href="https://github.com/quentin-tw/emis"><i class="fab fa-github-square"></i></a></h5>
<p class="text-justify">
    This website is to demonstrate commonly used functionalities of an
    aircraft engine maintenance information system (EMIS) for factory
    managers, engineers, and maintenance technicians. It includes multiple
    authorization levels and content limitation for different users,
    a dashboard to show overview of information and display
    the pending repairs demanding management actions. It can also provide
    lists of engines, maintenance details (maintenance logs), factories, and 
    contact personnel with detailed information. 
</p>
<h5>Demo Data</h5>
<p class="text-justify">
    To show the basic usage of this website, the database is provided
    with toy data of 15 engines, 3 maintenace factories, and 6 users. Several
    engines are assiociated with maintenance log information that contains details
    of a given repair event, such as the reason of repair, the current state of repair, 
    and the responsible personnel. The maintenance log also contains the 
    starting date and completion date (if completed) of the given repair event.
    These dates are used to calculated the turnaround time of a given repair.
</p>
<h5>Demo Users</h5>
<p class="text-justify">
    Two user accounts are provided to try out the system. User1 (senior manager) has a higher
    authorization level, and can view all information from different factories.
    User2 (site manager) can only view the engines and factory information assiociated
    with the site he/she works in.
</p>
<h5>Basic Usage</h5>
<p class="text-justify">
    You can login with username user1 (password: user1) or user2 (password: user2) 
    to access the webpages. Click the tag on the navigation bar for detailed information.
    You can search for a specific engine, a maintenance log, or a site in the search bar
    if you know the ID of the given data. Note that if you logged in as user2, 
    you will not able to get the engine, log, or site data that does not 
    belongs to the site (TORF) that you work in. Also, you will notice
    that the dashboard for user1 and user2 contains different information.
